# LEDDMX-00
This repo contains the payload data required to control light whose name has the pefix "LEDDMX-00". Some
of it may be applicable to other light types with similar prefixes however I have only tested with the aforementioned
"00" lights. The app that goes with these lights is called "LED LAMP" although there may be others
I have not yet come across.

The UUID of the service required for sending a payload is:

0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

The UUID of the characteristic that you should write to is:

0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
